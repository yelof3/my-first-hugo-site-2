      <description>&lt;p&gt;After some indirect encouragement from some folks on my Mastodon instance, I’ve decided to try my hand at Genuary! Each day of the month has a theme, which I’ve notated next to each header.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared to many, my love affair with code is rather young, so don’t expect to be blown away by any of these outputs. But rest assured knowing I had lots of fun creating them (and that I won’t be finishing every one)!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
