      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first radio show was back in high school on Aquidneck Island, at 7 am. My co-host and I were freeform selectors, with an emphasis on rap, funk, and humor. We got suspended from the station for peppering in Beavis and Butthead clips during the program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been a volunteer and DJ at BSR Live, (Brown Student and Community Radio) since 2010. My current show, The Fieldhouse, has been on (and off) air since 2012. I use that show to showcase quirky, fun minimal techno made with the use of field recordings.
