This garage parking assistant was a practical gag gift that I made for my Dad. He already had a perfectly accurate, low tech solution for the problem of how to determine when to stop pulling into the garage. But with time on my hands, I figured why not fix something that wasn’t broken! 

This build was based off of Ty Palowski’s project, and overall, it went great! I used an online 3D print shop for the case, and that whole process was very smooth overall. The only issue was that the code did not allow for the red light to turn off once the vehicle parked.

# Garage Parking Assistant Updates

Mid 2024: After some fishing around online, I met Hans from Germany, who shared with me his updated code for the garage parking assistant that contained the solution for the red light not turning off once the vehicle was parked. Thanks Hans!

He asked me for my help publishing the code online, which can be found at this [Github repo.](https://github.com/yelof3/ParkingGarageAssistant "garage-parking-assistant")


Here’s a view of the schematic I edited for the version.
