When I got laid off at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, I had some free time, and instead of learning to bake sourdough bread, I learned how to control LEDs.

I made several LED matrices, with this one being the largest so far. Iâ€™m currently in the logistics stage of a 1400 LED matrix, so check back in a bit.
