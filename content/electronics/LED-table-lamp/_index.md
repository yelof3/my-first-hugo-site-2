This was one of my quickest LED projects yet. One day I had a desire to deconstruct a light to retrofit with LEDs. After perusing the local Craigslist board, I wasn’t able to find any decent light hosts, so I just went down to the box store and grabbed a relatively cheap table lamp to improve. 

In it’s second version, I incorporated the open source WLED program to control the light display with my phone.
