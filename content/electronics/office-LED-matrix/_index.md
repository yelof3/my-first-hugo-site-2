I laid out most of the LEDs on this board during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably sometime in late 2020. Due to placing my attention on other projects, this took a bit of time to finish, but I’m happy to say it’s finally finished in January 2025!

It has an improvement from the original sketch- sound reactivity! 

# Router Improvement
Past matrices had rather rudimentary frames and diffusion panels, typically using computer paper as the diffusion material. Worked nicely for smaller matrices, but this time around, I needed a better way to build the frame. 

A wood router was the answer! That allowed me to cut even grooves for the diffusion panel, so that it was able to just slide right into the frame.
