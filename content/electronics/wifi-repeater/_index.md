- Node MCU ESP32 development board
- 2.4GHz Antenna
- Hobby knife
- Solder

What a fun little hack this wifi repeater was. Out of the hour or so of time required, 50 of those minutes are spent prepping the Node MCU board to solder the antenna to.

My daughter mentioned that she couldn’t video chat with her friend in her room due to a poor connection. A quick internet search lead me to a healthy search result filled with tutorials like this one. For the antenna attachment, I found this tutorial to be easy to follow.

Final results: no more data/buffering issues in my daughter’s room!
