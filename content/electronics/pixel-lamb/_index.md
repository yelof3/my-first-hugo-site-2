Pixel Lamb is a sound-reactive LED matrix that was made for Wooly Fair 2023 at The Steel Yard. After some repairs, it will be present for The Lint Ball!

When I got laid off at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, I had some free time, and instead of learning to bake sourdough bread, I learned how to control LEDs.

I made several LED matrices, with this one being the largest so far. I’m currently in the logistics stage of a 1400 LED matrix, so check back in a bit.

With the help of some good friends, Pixel Lamb production commenced in May of 2023 at Nicholson File, originally as a large wooden lattice structure. Unfortunately that design had to be abandoned and burned in the burn barrel.

The final design allowed for a full waterproofing, easy repair, and the ability to easily make a second side if desired. We found a sturdy wheeled cart to hang the Pixel Lamb from with 1/8″ aircraft cable, which, along with a portable battery, allowed for us to move the Lamb around the fair.

Overall, what an event! It was great to experience Wooly Fair this year from the artist side, rather than the management side. But the best part about this year was I was able to participate and build with my daughter.
