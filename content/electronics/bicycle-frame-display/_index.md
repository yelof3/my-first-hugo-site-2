I started riding with the Providence Bike Jam crew at the beginning of 2021, and I knew from my first ride that these were my folks. Lights, music, smiles, and bicycle advocacy; what’s not to love.

Given my recent excursion into the world of microprocessors and LEDs, I knew I had to make something for my bike. So, I made a rough trace of my frame space, cut some wood, plastered each side with LEDs. 

I can upload new patterns/designs to the Nano, which helps keep it fresh. I’m currently working on plans to adapt this rig to be sound reactive.
