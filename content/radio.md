My first radio show was back in high school on Aquidneck Island, at 7 am. My co-host and I were freeform selectors, with an emphasis on rap, funk, and humor. We got suspended from the station for peppering in Beavis and Butthead clips during the program.

I’ve been a volunteer and DJ at BSR Live, (Brown Student and Community Radio) since 2010. My current show, The Fieldhouse, has been on (and off) air since 2012. I use that show to showcase quirky, fun minimal techno made with the use of field recordings. Click here for some show archives.

After 12 years or programming, it was my time to say goodbye to BSR. You can catch me doing a guest mix now and then for my friend Quinn’s show Providance on Providence Community Radio.
