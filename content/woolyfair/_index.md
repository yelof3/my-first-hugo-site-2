The Wooly Fair is a participatory DIY art carnival held in Providence. I learned of it while on a date in 2013: she was connected with the Woolies, and said I really should meet them.

That I did.

While my date and I didn’t work out, after attending a Wooly meeting or two, I ended up going out with her and the creator of the Fair, Sam White, for a drink, where Sam asked if I wanted to be the Event Manager for the two day event that would be called Wooly Town.

It’s tough to describe the wonders of a Wooly Fair thing, but [the website](https://woolyfair.org "link to woolyfair.org") is a good place to go.

I need to collect some images I’ve taken on various devices and cards, but this will be where I’ll share some pics and videos of the last three (and only three) Wooly Fair events I’ve been to and helped create. Thank you, Sam White. Dave Allyn, and all the other Woolies for letting me create a bit of magic with you.
