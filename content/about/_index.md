This site was originally created as a work portfolio, while I was looking for a job. I got hired just as I was completing the site, so I turned it into a little portfolio of my fun-based projects. Below is a bit of info about me. 

## Foley
I’m the father of a kind, intelligent, funny and all around wonderful girl. I’m so lucky to be her Dad, and am amazed and inspired by her every day.

Professionally, I work in the ever-changing digital world. I help companies maximize their digital footprint through a variety of approaches: web development, SEO, email marketing, automation, CRM engineering, digital advertising campaign creation and management, analytics, and much more.

When I’m not working, I enjoy cycling, rock climbing, golf, electronics, hacking things, swimming, traveling around New England, and reading as many books on modern physics that I can get my hands on.
