This site was originally created as a work portfolio while I was looking for a job. I got hired just as I was completing the site, so I turned it into a little portfolio of my fun-based projects instead. 

I originally built it on a Wordpress install using the [Spun Theme](https://wordpress.com/theme/spun "Wordpress Spun theme"), but after ipage lagged on their PHP updates, I downloaded a plugin to revert back to previous Wordpress versions. I believe it was that plugin that infected my install, creating thousands of sales-slop pages. So in September of 2025 I killed that website and rebuilt it as this static website. 

## Foley
I’m the father of a kind, intelligent, funny and all around wonderful girl. I’m so lucky to be her Dad, and am amazed and inspired by her every day.

Professionally, I work in the ever-changing digital world. I help companies maximize their digital footprint through a variety of approaches: web development, SEO, email marketing, automation, CRM engineering, digital advertising campaign creation and management, analytics, and much more.

When I’m not working, I enjoy cycling, rock climbing, golf, electronics, hacking things, coding, swimming, traveling around New England, and [reading as many books on modern physics that I can get my hands on.](https://foley.works/reads "Link to reading list")
