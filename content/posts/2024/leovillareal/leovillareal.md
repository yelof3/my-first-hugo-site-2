I finally got a chance to head over to Brown University’s Lindemann Performing Arts Center to see [‘Infinite Composition‘](https://villareal.net/infinite-composition-2023 "link to Leo Villareal's webpage on the piece"), a white LED installation that has been in the building lobby since Fall 2023.

I became a fan of Villareal’s work via an accompanying soundtrack that was used in his installation in the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. This sountrack mix was created by James Healy, who along with DJ Olive created one of my favorite record labels of all time, [The Agriculture](http://www.theagriculture.com "link to the website for The Agriculture"). I originally found The Agriculture and DJ Olive in my freshman year of college as a burgeoning avant-garde/new music fan; I can’t remember who the exact collaborators were at this moment, but he was a turntablist who definitely wasn’t afraid of dipping his toes in more adventurous musics.

Years later I learned that Villareal and I went to the same high school.

He doesn’t know it, but he’s played a big part in spurring my love for LEDs.
