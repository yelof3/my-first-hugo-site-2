After some indirect encouragement from some folks on my Mastodon instance, I’ve decided to try my hand at Genuary! Each day of the month has a theme, which I’ve notated next to each header.

Compared to many, my love affair with code is rather young, so don’t expect to be blown away by any of these outputs. But rest assured knowing I had lots of fun creating them (and that I won’t be finishing every one)!
