The big LED matrix I made for Wooly Fair will be made an appearance in downtown Providence this weekend care of [the Avenue Concept](https://theavenueconcept.org "link to theavenueconcept.org")  , as part of the Three Nights of Lights Festival.

We were at 35 Weybosset Street on the evening of 12/1 and on Matthewson Street on the evening of 12/2, as part of the Avenue Concept roster of events.

Lots of amazing art, performance, and smiles on both nights. And of course, plenty of lights!
