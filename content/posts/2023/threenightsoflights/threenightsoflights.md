The big LED matrix I made for Wooly Fair will be made an appearance in downtown Providence this weekend, as part of the Three Nights of Lights Festival.

We were at 35 Weybosset Street on the evening of 12/1 and on Matthewson Street on the evening of 12/2, as part of the Avenue Concept roster of events.

Lots of amazing art, performance, and smiles on both nights. And of course, plenty of lights!
