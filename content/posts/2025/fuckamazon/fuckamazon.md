Fuck Amazon. Seriously. But more specifically, fuck Jeff Bezos. 

There are many, many reasons to hate Amazon, and Jeff Bezos. I tend to focus on worker and vendor conditions, and the fact that in his ideal world [(which we’re quickly heading towards)](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/23/amazon-replacing-employees-with-robots/ "Link to article about Amazon planning to replace up to 600,000 human workers with robots"), he would barely be employing any humans at all.  But really, take your pick from a long list of very good reasons across any of his business properties. Don’t even get me started on the Washington Post or the new Alexa security issues–topics for future blog posts, perhaps. 

Ethics aside, I just hate seeing one person or one company with the majority of the stuff.

But rather than rant about all that crap, I’m writing this post to remind people of just how easy it is to simply not use Amazon, ever.

My boycott of Amazon is roughly 15 years old, and going strong. If I need to order some random doo-dad or electronics piece online, my main go-to websites for convenience has been eBay. I’ll also try to use vendors like Digikey and Mouser for bulk electronics orders. After all these years of buying things on eBay, I don’t have a single complaint. Nearly every transaction has gone just as expected, and I can only remember a few occasions where I received something that was broken, or didn’t receive anything at all. In those situations, a solution was quickly reached, as you’d expect with any erroneous order on any other platform.

Personally, I don’t understand the big pull of the masses to Amazon. From what I’ve gathered, the main reason is convenience and speed of delivery/Prime. 

# How to Fuck Amazon and Jeff Bezos

It’s pretty simple! Here are some simple steps you can take:

Promise to never use:

- *Amazon*
- *Echo / Amazon Alexa* 
- *Audible*
- *Fire TV*
- *Goodreads*
- *Goodthreads*
- *Ring*
- *MGM Holdings: including MGM Studios, Orion Pictures, and United Artists*
- *Twitch*
- *IMDb*
- *Eero*

- *Zoox*
- *Zappos*
- *Wag*
- *Amazon Home Services*
- *Blink*

- *and many more!*

While you're at it, fuck the Washington Post too. There are thousands of reasons why you should have done so before now, but if you need a recent reason, their asshat op ed team just published some utter piece of shit defending the destruction of the East wing of the White House for some stupid Trump Ballroom. On top of that, Amazon donated 300 million toward the construction of it. 

I'm currently trying to never use Amazon Web Services (AWS) again, at least personally. Onward!
