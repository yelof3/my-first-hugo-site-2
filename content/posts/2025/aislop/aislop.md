There are a lot of things to hate about AI- many more issues than I could possibly cover in this one blog post. In no particular order, here are some of my particular gripes with AI, and why I think it should be regulated more closely. 

## AI Produces Slop
In areas where it seems to be used most, AI produces slop. From imagry to video to music, and everything else in between, AI tools are great at churning out mediocre results that are devoid of the human element that made its learning material so great in the first place.

## AI Removes the Fun of Learning 
I love the process of learning, and figuring things out. Half the time, that's why I get involved in certain hobbies; it's less about the end goal for me, and more about the process of learning and growing. AI tools, no matter what the flavor, seem to take away this important aspect, or at least severely compromise the efficacy of it. I have friends who code with Claude Code and create music 'productions' with the help of other AI applications, and I simply can't imagine going about thing as they are. I'd be giving away the main reason why I'm going about the thing in the first place.

## It Snuffs out Creative Potential in exchange for Immediate Results
This is somewhat related to the previous contention, but has worth as its own section. With the right amount of experience and education, the human brain is capable of some really amazing creative feats. The potential for those feats to realize is snuffed out when people's first move is to go to their favorite AI chat bot to inform them of their next step or output. 

## It's a Waste of Energy Resources
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates in a [recent study](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-report-evaluating-increase-electricity-demand-data-centers "link to U.S. Department of Energy study on data center energy consumption")
that 4.4% of total energy consumed in the US in 2023 was by data centers. By 2028, that esitimate jumps up to 6.7%-12%. Additionally, many of the data centers are built in areas where the energy grid is particularly 'dirty', and with that, many of the data centers are very carbon intensive. 
  
[This article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/ "link to MIT Technology Review article") in the MIT Technology Review does a good job of providing an overlay of the AI energy cosumption issue. 


## The Rush to add AI to Everything
I work in tech, and it seems that every product or tool I use on a regular basis has been shoving some sort of quick-to-market AI marekting slop about their new shiney AI tool, just trying to beat out their market competitors. I'm *so* sick of it. It's affecting lots of industries, of course, but from my perspective, no matter its application, it seems the negatives are greater than the positives. And given the massive energy consumption needed currently, the the expoential amount needed in the coming years, I can't imagine ever seeing a scenario where that isn't the case.
